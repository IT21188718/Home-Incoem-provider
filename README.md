Income generally refers to the money earned by an individual or organization from various sources such as salaries, wages, investments, or business profits. It is a key component of personal and business finances and is usually subject to taxes and other deductions.

In the context of personal finance, income can be categorized as either active or passive. Active income refers to money earned from actively working and providing services, such as salaries or wages from a job. Passive income, on the other hand, refers to money earned from investments or other sources that do not require active effort or work.

In the context of an Android app, income can refer to the revenue generated by the app through various means, such as in-app purchases, advertisements, or subscriptions. Developers may also earn income from app sales or from licensing their technology to other businesses. The income generated by an Android app can be a key indicator of its success and profitability.
